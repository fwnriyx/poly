In this project, I make use of javascript's object oriented programming to create a hypothetical membership loyalty program for company xyz. Using readline sync, I tried to recreate a scenario where a staff would enter the program and try to find out the amount of points a customer has, adding a customer into the program as well as to display customer information when prompted with their name in the terminal.

I am well aware that this project may be of lower quality, and I aim to redo this when I have the time to :)
