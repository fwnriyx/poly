            I entered Singapore Polytechnic as a Year 1 in April 2022. My experience so far has been nothing
            less than delightful.
            Despite being from different backgrounds, the activities held on the orientation day helped us to know each
            other better
            as classmates, which helped to spark more conversations and friendships. It
            is much more different than secondary school as it is more self oriented and I had to work on my time
            management. In my opinion, DCITP is a good course as the workload is not too high and it sets the stepping
            stones for us before we progress into the next semester At the end of this semester,
            I am required to choose between Infocomm Security Management(DISM), Information Technology(DIT), or Applied
            AI
            and Analytics(DAAA)! To see an average month in my life during the ESTs, open this <a class="link" href=Calendar.html>link!</a>

            To be completely honest, I joined canoe sprint due to the seniors I knew that joined,
            but I stayed for the people that I met along the way of trials and trainings. I row
            the k-boat, which uses 2 sides. Outside of Canoe Sprint, I am planning to join
            dragonboat again and I also play volleyball once in a while.

                  In SP, Diploma in Infocomm Security Management (DISM) students will be learning more about
                  security technology, security management, information technology, law and teamwork and communications.
                  They
                  will also have an internship in year 3 that lasts for roughly 22 weeks. Some of the career options
                  that
                  are
                  available include: Cyber Risk Analyst, Forensic Investigator and Incident Investigator. In my opinion,
                  this is
                  my most preferred course as I have the most interest in the career options as well as the topics

                  In SP, Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics (DAAA) students are able to learn how to
                  develop AI applications that
                  benefits our world. They constantly receive new challenges that they get to pick at. Some of the
                  topics
                  they will learn are Data Engineering, Deep Learning as well as Data Structures & Algorithm. In my
                  opinion, I am
                  slightly interested in this course as it broadens my knowledge regarding the technology that we use
                  around us, but I am
                  not too interested in going in depth into these topics. Hence, I am more interested in this course
                  than DIT, but less than
                  DISM. Learn more <a id="spLinks2" style="color: blue;"

                  User Experience (UX) Immersive Simulation and have an internship that starts in year 3 spanning for

                  opinion, this is my least
                  preferred course among the three I have to pick from this term as I do not have much interest in these
