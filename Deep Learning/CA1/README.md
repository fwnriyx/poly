In this project, there are 2 parts:
    1: Implement an image classifier using a deep learning network. You are given colour images of 224 by 224 pixels, containing 15 types of vegetables.
    2: Build a next-word predictor, given a sequence of words.

In part 1:
    Features I considered:
        -Augmentation (Class balancing)
        -Parameter Tuning (Best hyperparameters)
        -Model architecture (Efficiency and effectiveness)
        -Generalization (prevent overfitting)
        -Regularization

```python
        
```
