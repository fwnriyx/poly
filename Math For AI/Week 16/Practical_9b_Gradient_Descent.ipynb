    "# Practical 9b: Gradient Descent Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a local minimum of a function $z=f(x,y)$, the gradient descent algorithm can be implemented. The partial derivatives of the function, $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}$ are needed and can be obtained using the SymPy library. The algorithm works this way,\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 0.\tSet a learning rate $\\alpha>0$ and an initial point $x=x_0,\\ y=y_0$ and compute $f(x_0,y_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1.\tAt n-th point $x=x_n,\\ y=y_n$, compute ${{f}_{x}}({{x}_{n}},{{y}_{n}})$ and $f_y(x_n,y_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2.\tUpdate to the (n+1)-th point, $x_{n+1}=x_n-\\alpha f_x(x_n,y_n), \\ y_{n+1}=y_n-\\alpha f_y(x_n,y_n)$ and compute $f(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3.\tRepeat step 1 and 2 until a stopping criterion is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each or a combination of the following can be the stopping criterion:    \n",
    "1.\tThe **maximum number of iterations** is reached.\n",
    "2.\tThe **value of $f_x^2(x_n,y_n)+ f_y^2(x_n,y_n)$** is smaller than a fixed constant. \n",
    "3.\t**Convergence**, which, in simple terms, means that the update to the current point does not differ much from the previous point. It can refer to little difference from $x=x_n,\\ y=y_n$ to $x=x_{n+1},\\ y=y_{n+1}$ or little reduction in $f(x_{n},y_{n})$ to $f(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})$ (the difference is smaller than a fixed constant).\n",
    " \n",
    "As an example, we want to find the minimum of the function $f(x,y)=x^2+3y^2$. The partial derivatives are $f_x(x,y) = 2x$ and $f_y(x,y)=6y$. With an initial point of $x=4,\\ y=5$, learning rate $\\alpha=0.1$, the code for the algorithm is as follows,"
