Not my proudest work, but this was my first ever attempt at anything related to programming. Using a mixture of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I attempted to make a website (note attempted) with quite a bit of effort. By trying this out, I got a detailed (yet somehow vague) idea of how coding worked.

Similar to Fundamentals of Programming, I would like to redo this project when I have spare time, and brush up EVERYTHING, especially the colors, pictures and fonts used, which I am well aware are not the best.
