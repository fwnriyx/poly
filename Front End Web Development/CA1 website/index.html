            <p id="rcorners"> <img id="myPic" src="HTMLpics/dbsolo.jpg" alt="A picture of me"><br><br>Hello! My name is Fitri,
                previously from Pioneer
                Primary School and Jurong Secondary
                School. I have been in 3 CCAs so far,
                most notably robotics in primary school, as well as volleyball and dragonboat in secondary school. I am
                now in SP canoe sprint.<br>
                My personality type is INFJ-A, which just basically means that I prioritise being compassionate and
                empathising towards others. I also strongly hold the value of loyalty.<br>
                Some of my interests include water sports in general and chess. I am also interested in volleyball and
                often
                play it with friends over the holidays and weekend, and my favorite subjects in Secondary School were
                A Math and Pure History.

            <p id="rcorners2"> I joined the Jurong Secondary School boys volleyball team as the first batch in 2021.
                As I was in a team sport for
                3 years before volleyball, it was easier for me to adapt and learn along with my teammates. Even
                though we lacked experience,
                I felt that the synergy we had cant be replaced and we had a lot of fun playing together. One of our
                matches can be viewed <a id="vbVideo" href="https://youtu.be/0q2XPb81RB0">here</a>.

            <p id="rcorners3"> I joined the Jurong Secondary School Dragonboat team when I was in Secondary 1 in
                2018. In my time there, I learnt
                the importance of teamwork. I met some lifelong friends that rowed with me throughout the four
                years, and juniors
                and seniors that also trained with me. I was in Dragonboat until 2021, where I joined volleyball for
                a year.

            <p id="rcorners1">I started playing chess when I was 6 because my older cousins were in Chess as their CCAs and
                often
                taught me how to play when I was younger. This sparked my interest and I played in tournaments
                overseas until I was 10 years old. I have been playing games since the start of my chess "career" as it
                would help me to kill my
                boredom when waiting for games and would kill time for me when I am not studying. I also like watching
                shows,
                mostly japanese animes, a lot during my free time. A list of the animes I have watched can be seen <a
