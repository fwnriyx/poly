    "## **Background Information:**\n",
    "> A payment default usually happens after multiple payments on a loan or other debt are missed. The default happens when the lender decides to cut their losses. It also can be caused by spending over your credit limit, which forces your account into a default so that the lender can cut their losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, I have to make a few assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bills and pays are on consecutive months\n",
    "- The bills do not accumulate, and are individually calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "And based on the background context I gave in the first line, we can also conclude that people who spend more than their credit limit will be forced into a default.\n",
