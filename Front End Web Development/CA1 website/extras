    <p id="rcorners">I entered Singapore Polytechnic as a Year 1 in April 2022. My experience so far has been nothing
        less than delightful.
        Despite being from different backgrounds, the activities held on the orientation day helped us to know each
        other better
        as classmates, which helped to spark more conversations and friendships. It
        is much more different than secondary school as it is more self oriented and I had to work on my time
        management. In my opinion, DCITP is a good course as the workload is not too high and it sets the stepping
        stones for us before we progress into the next semester At the end of this semester,
        I am required to choose between Infocomm Security Management(DISM), Information Technology(DIT), or Applied AI
        and Analytics(DAAA)! But for now,
        below is a rough overview of every school week, and to the right, is the different courses I can pick at the end
        of the semester:
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column1">
            <h2>DIT:</h2><br>
            <p id="rcorners2">According to the SP website, after the first semester, Diploma in Information
                Technology (DIT) students will be learning more in depth Software Development
                User Experience (UX) Immersive Simulation and have an internship that starts in year 3 spanning for
                about 22 weeks. Some of the Career
                options that are available are Software Quality Assurance Engineer, UI Designer and UX Designer. In my
                opinion, this is my least
                preferred course among the three I have to pick from this term as I do not have much interest in these
                career options and topics. Learn

            <h2>DISM:</h2><br>
            <p id="rcorners3">In SP, Diploma in Infocomm Security Management (DISM) students will be learning more about
                security technology, security management, information technology, law and teamwork and communications.
                They
                will also have an internship in year 3 that lasts for roughly 22 weeks. Some of the career options that
                are
                available include: Cyber Risk Analyst, Forensic Investigator and Incident Investigator. In my opinion,
                this is
                my most preferred course as I have the most interest in the career options as well as the topics taught
                throughout
                the next few years. Learn more <a id="spLinks" style="color: blue;"

            <h2>DAAA:</h2>
            <p id="rcorners4">In SP, Diploma in Applied AI and Analytics (DAAA) students are able to learn how to
                develop AI applications that
                benefits our world. They constantly receive new challenges that they get to pick at. Some of the topics
                they will learn are Data Engineering, Deep Learning as well as Data Structures & Algorithm. In my opinion, I am
                slightly interested in this course as it broadens my knowledge regarding the technology that we use around us, but I am
                not too interested in going in depth into these topics. Hence, I am more interested in this course than DIT, but less than
                DISM. Learn more <a id="spLinks" style="color: blue;"
